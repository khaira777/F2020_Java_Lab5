Exercise 1:

Develop a GUI Java application that will allow the players to submit information about themselves
and the games that they are playing on-line. The information will be stored in a simple Oracle
database. The database tables are shown in the following picture:

You can use SQL Developer to create your database in Oracle server.

You should populate the table Game with titles of games that you have "played" during this
semester.

Your GUI should provide the necessary SWING or JavaFX components that will allow the user to
enter and display the data. You will use JDBC to provide the following operations:

1. Insert game and player information into the database.
2. Update the existing player information.
3. Display reports with player and played games information. You may use a JTable or other
components to display the reports. Allow the user to select player_id.

Use prepared statements to implement all database operations.
